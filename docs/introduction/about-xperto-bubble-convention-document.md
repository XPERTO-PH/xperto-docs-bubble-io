## What is this?
This is a standardize conventions for XPERTO platform.

## Why do we need conventions tho?
This is to create standardized frameworks that everyone can follow, like how to name things, where to put them, so that its easy to understand by everyone.

## Who should read this?
Any one that works with Bubble should read this, from newbies to seniors. We believe following standards helps newbies learn quicker and produce easier-to-read codes (or no-code?) and seniors maintain their legacy code better (if they ever do that).

However, it would be a bit more difficult for new Bubblers to read, since some features would be a bit technical-heavy. We will provide a lot of explanations though.

This is currently maintained by XPERTO team. Any change to this document is discussed and decided by XPERTO team.
